Built basic web applications using JavaScript to add interactivity to web pages. Worked with DOM manipulation to create dynamic content, form validation, and simple event handling. Focused on learning core JavaScript concepts like variables, loops, functions, and objects while improving problem-solving skills through hands-on coding.
